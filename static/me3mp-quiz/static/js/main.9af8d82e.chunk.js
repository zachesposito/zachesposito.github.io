After 1 second you shoot them again and they receive another identical DOT. How much total damage will the enemy receive from the two DOTs?","choices":[{"id":1,"label":"Each DOT ticks on its own, so (50 * 3) + (50 * 3) = 300 total damage"},{"id":2,"label":"The second DOT cancels the first, so (50 * 1) + (50 * 3) = 200 damage"},{"id":3,"label":"The second DOT absorbs the first and combines their damage, so (50 * 1) + (100 * 3) = 350 damage"}],"answer":3,"explanation":"Multiple instances of the same DOT have their damage combined which ticks over the duration of a single DOT. This can be exploited with a fast-firing gun like the Reegar to build DOTs that tick for huge amounts of damage quickly."},{"id":5,"instructions":"On an assassination objective wave, if the first target is a difficult enemy, how can you force subsequent targets to be something easier to deal with?","choices":[{"id":1,"label":"Shoot the target down as fast as possible"},{"id":2,"label":"Finish the target off with a melee attack"},{"id":3,"label":"Ragdoll the target off the map"},{"id":4,"label":"Blow up the target and a lesser enemy at the same time with a Cobra missle"}],"answer":4,"explanation":"If for example the target is an Atlas and you use a Cobra missle to blow it up along with an Assault Trooper, there is a high chance the next target will be an Assault Trooper due to how the wave enemy budget is calculated."},{"id":6,"instructions":"What are the weak points on an Atlas?","choices":[{"id":1,"label":"The shoulders, knees, groin, and canopy"},{"id":2,"label":"The canopy and back vent"},{"id":3,"label":"The shoulders, groin, canopy, and back vent"},{"id":4,"label":"The shoulders, knees, groin, and back vent"}],"answer":4,"explanation":"Shooting the plates off of the shoulders, knees, and groin will stun the Atlas and deal extra damage, and shooting the back vent deals extra damage like a headshot.
