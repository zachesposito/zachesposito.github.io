## Hi, I'm Zach.
I do full-stack software development out of Toledo, OH. Learn everything and share it.

Outside of software I raise two beautiful kids with my wife. In my spare time I like studying [martial arts](https://www.ohiomartialarts.com/our-history), classical guitar, running, cooking for my family, and [playing co-op games](https://www.reddit.com/r/MECoOp/).
